# Pareto

"Pareto" is an SSR (Server Side Rendering) framework that centers on stream rendering. In my view, if React server components are considered as 100% performance optimization for React applications, then stream rendering is akin to 80% optimization. However, in contrast to server components which demand 100% effort, stream rendering only necessitates 20% of the effort. The name Pareto is derived from the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, which suggests that a majority of effects (80%) are typically produced by a minority of causes (20%).
