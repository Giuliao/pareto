# Introduction

## Position

Pareto is a React SSR framework based on rspack, dedicated to making your use of streaming rendering simple. It doesn't have many complex encapsulations, 
essentially it's just a simple wrapper for React SSR applications.

## Project Background

Pareto is designed as a streamlined `MPA` architecture, 
so it might be more suitable for those who need to develop embedded web pages in mobile webviews. 
We considered many performance optimization factors from the beginning of the design, and combined it with 
streaming rendering. For example:

1. Critical CSS: Pareto has built-in support for critical CSS, which is much faster than using external CSS. 
For more details, you can refer to https://web.dev/articles/extract-critical-css?hl=zh-cn
2. `react-helmet-async`: Pareto has built-in support for metadata, which will be sent to the browser at the beginning 
of the request.
3. SPA: Pareto has built-in support for SPA mode. When your server traffic is too large, you can 
choose to switch to SPA mode to increase capacity.
